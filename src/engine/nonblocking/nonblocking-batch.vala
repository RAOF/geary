/**
 * NonblockingBatch allows for multiple asynchronous tasks to be executed in parallel and for their
 * results to be examined after all have completed.  It's designed specifically with Vala's async
 * keyword in mind.
 *
 * Although the yield keyword allows for async tasks to execute, it only allows them to performed
 * in serial.  In a loop, for example, the next task in the loop won't execute until the current
 * one has completed.  The thread of execution won't block waiting for it, but this can be
 * suboptiminal and certain cases.
 *
 * NonblockingBatch allows for multiple async tasks to be gathered (via the add() method) into a
 * single batch.  Each task must subclass from NonblockingBatchOperation.  It's expected that the
 * subclass will maintain state particular to the operation, although NonblockingBatch does gather
 * two types of a results the task may generate: a result object (which descends from Object) or
 * a thrown exception.  Other results should be stored by the subclass.
 *
 * To use, create a NonblockingBatch and populate it via the add() method.  When all
 * NonblockingBatchOperations have been added, call execute_all_async().  NonblockingBatch will fire off
 * all at once and only complete execute_all_async() when all of them have finished.  As mentioned
 * earlier, it's also gather their returned objects and thrown exceptions while they run.  See
 * get_result() and throw_first_exception() for more information.
 *
 * The caller will want to call *either* get_result() or throw_first_exception() to ensure that
 * errors are propagated.  It's not necessary to call both.
 *
 * After execute_all_async() has completed, the results may be examined.  The NonblockingBatch object
 * can *not* be reused.
 *
 * Currently NonblockingBatch will fire off all operations at once and let them complete.  It does
 * not attempt to stop the others if one throws exception.  Also, there's no algorithm to submit the
 * operations in smaller chunks (to avoid flooding the thread's MainLoop).  These may be added in
 * the future.
